Cachesim.c simulates how memory cache works in c. Given a type of  cachesize, assoicativity(ex. direct, full, or n: ), replacement argument(ex. fifo), block size, and the trace files that contain a list of writes and reads of various memory addresses. 
Then, cachesim will find out exactly how many memory reads and writes, cache hits and misses, and calculates the same for when it uses prefetching.
